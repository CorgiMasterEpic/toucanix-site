# Toucanix

Toucanix is an operating system developed by **CorgiMasterEpic**.

- [Github](https://github.com/CorgiMasterEpic/Toucanix)

## Overview

Toucanix is a clean, modern, hobbyist operating system built from scratch in **C++**.  
It focuses on simplicity, learning, and long-term experimentation rather than competing with established operating systems.

**This project includes the following**

- A custom **C++ kernel**
- A **C-based UEFI bootloader** for maximum compatibility
- A completely independent architecture (not Linux, not BSD)
- A fun and unique toucan-themed identity

You can see more details on other pages.

## Goat (GNU alternitave for Toucanix)
This contains stuff like reimplemented core utils (sort of doing its own thing).
Maybe even gcc/g++/ld alternitaves like clang & lld reimplmented.
And of cource cargo & rustc reimplmented (maybe).
