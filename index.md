# Toucanix

Toucanix is an operating system developed by **CorgiMasterEpic**.

- [Github](https://github.com/CorgiMasterEpic/Toucanix)

## Overview

Toucanix is a clean, modern, hobbyist operating system built from scratch in **C++**.  
It focuses on simplicity, learning, and long-term experimentation rather than competing with established operating systems.

**This project includes the following**

- A custom **C++ kernel**
- A **C-based UEFI bootloader** for maximum compatibility
- A completely independent architecture (not Linux, not BSD)
- A fun and unique toucan-themed identity
